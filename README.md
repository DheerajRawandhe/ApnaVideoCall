#Apna-Video-Call
This is a Video Call Web App made by me. It allows two or more users to make video calls using their browsers.

Dheeraj Video Call (DVC) is a real-time video calling web application that allows users to connect with each other using audio and video through their web browsers.
This app uses WebRTC and Socket.io to create smooth peer-to-peer video calls. It is built using Node.js, Express, and JavaScript. The app is perfect for one-to-one or group video calls using a shared Room ID.
The main goal of this project is to understand real-time communication using WebRTC and to build a working video call system like Google Meet or Zoom.
